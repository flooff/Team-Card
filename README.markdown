# 3D CSS Parallax Depth Effect

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/dazulu/pen/VVZrQv](https://codepen.io/dazulu/pen/VVZrQv).

Playing with CSS translate and rotate transforms based on `mousemove` (sorry mobile users ðŸ˜…) to simulate some z-axis depth on the card and individual movie characters.

_Thanks @alice-mx for improving the calcValue math_
